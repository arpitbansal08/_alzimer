An AI-driven diagnostic system addresses the pressing need for accurate and timely diagnosis
of chronic neurological illnesses (CNIs). By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms,
the system enhances diagnostic precision, accessibility, and efficiency, ultimately improving
patient outcomes.
## Key features include:
●  Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Extracting and preprocessing patient data from
electronic health records and medical imaging studies.

● Algorithm Development and Training: Developing and training AI algorithms using
machine learning and deep learning techniques.

● Clinical Integration: Integrating the AI-driven diagnostic system into existing clinical
workflows and healthcare information systems.

● Validation and Regulatory Compliance: Validating the system's performance through
rigorous testing and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

● Benefits: Increased diagnostic accuracy, faster diagnosis, reduced healthcare costs,
and improved patient care.

Our system represents a significant advancement in CNI diagnosis, offering a scalable, cost-
effective solution that empowers healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions
and provide better care for individuals affected by these debilitating neurological conditions.

## UNIQUE APPROACH
The uniqueness of our approach is the fact that we would be including metrices like MMSE and Education also in our model to train it to differentiate between normal healthy adults and those with Alzheimer's. MMSE is one of the gold standards for determining dementia and hence we think it is an important feature to include.

The same fact also make our approach flexible enough to be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases which are diagnosed using a combination of MRI features and cognitive tests.
